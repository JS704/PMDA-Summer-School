### Introduction

The **Predictive Modeling and Data Analytics** (PMDA) chapter is a multidisciplinary team in the department of Pharmaceutical Sciences at Roche. The chapter develops and applies data analysis, visualization, and modeling tools for pharma research and early development. To introduce students to applied predictive modeling and data analysis in drug discovery and development, the PMDA chapter hosts a one-week summer school in Basel.


### Topic

The topic of the PMDA summer school 2022 is **single-cell gene expression** in drug discovery. A large amount of single-cell gene expression data is available across organisms, diseases, tissues and cell types. Many drug-discovery projects rely on such data to make informed decisions such as target identification, mode-of-action profiling, and safety assessment. The limited summarisation functionality we have so far does not take complexity of study designs and heterogeneity of profiling techniques into account. We lack both simple yet powerful summary visualizations and interpretable summary metrics to answer questions like “In what cell types, tissues, and states (disease/healthy/development) is gene X (preferentially) expressed".


### Application

We welcome **Ph.D. students and outstanding master students** of University Basel and ETH D-BSSE with backgrounds in mathematics, statistics, data science, computing sciences, physics, biology and relevant backgrounds to apply before June 1st. During the summer school you will be part of one of the three teams and work together with other participants with different knowledge and backgrounds to create algorithms, develop metrics, and develop visualization techniques. You will discuss and work with industrial research scientists to visualize, quantify, and interpret specificity, variability, and uncertainty of cell-type specific gene expression and co-expression. Via this hands-on project, you will have the opportunity to experience real research questions in an industrial setting.


To apply, please submit both a Motivation Letter and a CV. For registration purposes the motivation letter and CV must be combined in one document and uploaded via the registration form accessed using the Register Now link below.
